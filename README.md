## Cell counts
Overview of cell counts in dataset.

## ECI vs ECII
Overrepresentation analysis of the Endothelial Cells I versus Endothelial Cells II clusters.

## Corrected counts for sc analysis
More equal patient contribution to all cell clusters.

## Calculate DEG
Calculate differentially expressed genes for every cell cluster between selected parameters.

## Construct pseudobulk
Create pseudo-bulk from single cell data (per cell cluster per patient).

## Visualize DEG
Make dotplots showing average expression of differentially expressed genes.

## Single cell to bulk
Look up differentially expressed genes of single cell in bulk RNA seq data.

## Bulk DEG analysis
Calculate differentially expressed genes in bulk RNA seq data and look up these genes in single cell RNA seq data.

## GSEA
Gene set enrichment analysis for every cell cluster between selected parameters.

## Immune cells vs structural cells ratio
Ratio of immune cells versus structural cells for every patient.

## Macrophage and T cell vs structural cell ratio
Ratio of macrophages and T cells versus structural cells for every patient.

## More specific immune cell versus structural cell ratio
Ratio of macrophage and T cell subtypes versus structural cells for every patient.
